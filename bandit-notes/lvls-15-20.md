## lvl 16-17
#### Instructions 
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.
- Tried `nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost` first which showed me 5 ports but no info on ssl
- Then used -sV option to see what service is running on each port
```
PORT      STATE SERVICE  
31046/tcp open  echo
31518/tcp open  ssl/echo
31691/tcp open  echo
31790/tcp open  ssl/unknown
31960/tcp open  echo
```
- Used openssl to connect to port 31790 but it responded with KEYUPDATE. Hint in the instructions mentioned this so I checked `man openssl s_client` and found -quiet under the connected commands section. Below command worked and responded with sshkey that I saved to [bandit17sshkey.private](sshkeys/bandit17sshkey.private)
```
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet
```

## Level 17-18
#### Instructions
There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new
```
bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.new passwords.old
